#Problems:
* the gemini api can only supply 15 request per minute and 1500 request per day : possible solution is to compile all reviewer in a single call but this will significantly lower the quality of each reviewer, best solution is to avail the fking paid api.
* youtube transcriptor is not always available in every video since some videos do not actually have substitles : out of my control lol
